| pial interlaminar astrocyte (CL:4042010) | An interlaminar astrocyte whose soma is part of the first layer of a neocortex and is in contact with a pia surface. |
| interstitial extravillous trophoblast cell (CL:4033062) | A trophoblast cell that invades the uterine wall to anchor the placenta to the uterus. An interstitial extravillous trophoblast cell differentiates from an extravillous trophoblast cell, becoming hyperchromatic and changing its morphology to a fibroblast-like spindle-shaped cell. In humans, this cell can be distinguished by the expression of placental-specific protein 8, which stimulates migration. |
| interlaminar astrocyte (CL:4042009) | An astrocyte type that presents radial protrusions across the layers of a cortex. The soma of this astrocyte is part of the first layer of a neocortex. This astrocyte extents its protrusions transversally to the deeper layers of a cortex and it creates contact with neurons, the pia matter and capillaries. This astrocyte is involved in facilitating the communication across neurons, astrocytes, capillaries, meninges and the cerebrospinal fluid. |
| L2 intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic neuron (CL:4030060) | An intratelencephalic-projecting glutamatergic neuron with a soma found in cortical layer 2. |
| border associated macrophage (CL:4042003) | A central nervous system macrophage that is part of a choroid plexus, a meninx and a perivascular space. A border associated macrophage interacts with various components of the CNS vasculature and meninges, it participates in immune surveillance and in the regulation of the blood brain barrier. |
